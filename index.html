  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Movie Book Club &middot; Effective February 19, 2026</p>

  <h2>What Movie Book Club Is</h2>
  <p>Movie Book Club is a mobile app for small groups to experience and discuss movies, books, TV shows, and other media together. It is designed to be calm and private — no social feeds, no algorithms, no ads.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only what is necessary for the app to function:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for account authentication</li>
    <li><strong>Username</strong> — chosen by you, visible to your club members and friends</li>
    <li><strong>Discussion posts and quotes</strong> — content you write in club discussions</li>
    <li><strong>Private notes</strong> — personal notes you write about works; visible only to you</li>
    <li><strong>Reading/watch progress</strong> — your progress through works and sections</li>
    <li><strong>Friendships</strong> — mutual friend connections you initiate and accept</li>
    <li><strong>Push notification tokens</strong> — used to deliver notifications to your device</li>
    <li><strong>Notification preferences</strong> — your chosen reminder timing settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>Your data is used exclusively to provide the app's features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticating your account</li>
    <li>Displaying your username to club members and friends</li>
    <li>Showing your discussion posts to other club members</li>
    <li>Tracking your progress through works and sections</li>
    <li>Enforcing spoiler gates based on your progress and deadlines</li>
    <li>Sending push notifications for deadline reminders and club activity</li>
    <li>Showing your completed works to accepted friends (unless you mark them private)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app relies on two third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — provides authentication and database hosting. Your data is stored in a Supabase-managed PostgreSQL database. <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Expo</strong> — provides push notification delivery. Your device's push token is sent to Expo's notification service. <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy">Expo Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use analytics services, tracking pixels, advertising networks, or any other third-party tools.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third party. Your data is only visible to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You (all your own data)</li>
    <li>Your club members (discussion posts, username, progress within shared clubs)</li>
    <li>Your accepted friends (username and completed works you haven't marked private)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored in a Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL database with row-level security policies that restrict access at the database level. Authentication tokens are stored in your device's secure keychain. All communication between the app and our servers uses HTTPS encryption.</p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete your account at any time from the Profile screen in the app. Deletion is immediate and permanent — there is no grace period or recovery option.</p>
  <p>When you delete your account:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your profile, memberships, progress, private notes, friendships, push tokens, and notification preferences are permanently deleted</li>
    <li>Your discussion posts and suggestions are preserved for other club members, but your name is replaced with "Deleted User"</li>
    <li>If you own a club, ownership is transferred to the next longest-tenured member</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>Movie Book Club is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has created an account, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we make material changes to this policy, we will update this page with a new effective date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or your data, you can reach us at <a href="mailto:moviebookclub.app@gmail.com">moviebookclub.app@gmail.com</a>.</p>
